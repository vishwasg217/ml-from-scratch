# ML From Scratch 
**Exploring ML and DL Algorithms Under the Hood.**

---

ML From Scratch is a project aimed at helping individuals develop a fundamental understanding of various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms by coding them from scratch. Each algorithm implementation is provided in a separate Jupyter notebook, allowing you to explore and comprehend the algorithms without relying on external libraries like `scikit-learn`. Additionally, links to resources in the form of blog posts and videos (thanks to [statquest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest)) are provided to aid you in grasping the inner workings of these algorithms.

## Algorithms
Below is a table summarizing the algorithms covered in the project, along with links to their respective notebooks and explanation resources:
